# Converting Types to Comparable

When writing a function for conversion from the type you want to use within a set to comparable
it's very important to make sure every distinct member of the type produces different value in the set of comparables.

Take for instance those two examples:

We can use store Bool in Set (No matter how unpractical it might seem)

    boolToInt : Bool -> Int
    boolToInt bool =
        case bool of
            False -> 0
            True -> 1

    empty boolToInt
    |> insert True
    |> member True
    --> True

or Maybe String.

    comparableKey : Maybe String -> (Int, String)
    comparableKey maybe =
        case maybe of
            Nothing -> (0, "")
            Just str -> (1, str)

    empty comparableKey
        |> insert (Just "foo")
        |> member (Just "foo")
    --> True

Note that we give Int code to either constructor and in case of Nothing we default to `""` (empty string).
There is still a difference between `Nothing` and `Just ""` (`Int` value in the pair is different).
In fact, you can "hardcode" any value as the second member of the pair
in case of Nothing but empty string seems like a reasonable option for this case.
Generally, this is how I would implement `toComparable` function for most of your custom data types.
Have a look at the longest constructor,
Define tuple where the first key is int (number of the constructor)
and other are types within the constructor and you're good to go.
